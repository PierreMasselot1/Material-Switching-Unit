# Material Switching Unit (MSU)

The Material Switching Unit is a multi-material upgrade for 3D printers based on the MMU2 that allows printing of up to 5 filaments while staying under 80$ and being compatible with most FDM 3D printers out there.

```diff
- This project is currently in a limbo state, I do not have access to the physical device for the next 2 months so won't be making a lot of progress. I will try my best to help sort out any bugs that may appear.
```

# Getting started

Clone the repository using the following command (you will need [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your machine)

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/PierreMasselot1/Material-Switching-Unit.git
`

Once this is done you should now have access to the different parts required for this project. The Marlin folder contains the modified firmware that will allow you to control the MSU and the parts forlder contains all the 3D files that you will need.

have a look at the [build guide](https://github.com/PierreMasselot1/Material-Switching-Unit/blob/main/Build_guide_MSU.md) for further guidance on how to get the MSU up and running!

# Goals

* The MSU is currently still a prototype, improving reliability is currentlyy the main goal. The main focus being at the Slicer level ([here](https://github.com/PierreMasselot1/SuperSlicer) is the fork that I am working on) but also some improvements that can still be done to the actual device.

* Presets and profiles! Not having the tweak the MSU for hours will make the barrier to entry much lower

# Notes

The main barrier I have right now is time, juggling everything from uni and career to friends and sports does take quite a bit of time so if you see that this repo hasn't been updated in a while it's not because the project is dead ;) it's just that I haven't had the time to work on it.
