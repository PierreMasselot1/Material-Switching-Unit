# Material Switching Unit (MSU)

The Material Switching Unit is a multi-material upgrade for 3D printers based on the MMU2 that allows printing of up to 5 filaments while staying under 80$ and being compatible with most FDM 3D printers out there.

# Getting started

Clone the repository using the following command (you will need [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your machine)

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/PierreMasselot1/Material-Switching-Unit.git
`

Once this is done you should now have access to the different parts required for this project. The Marlin folder contains the modified firmware that will allow you to control the MSU and the parts forlder contains all the 3D files that you will need.

Have a look at the [build guide](https://github.com/PierreMasselot1/Material-Switching-Unit/blob/main/Build_guide_MSU.md) for further guidance on how to get the MSU up and running!
